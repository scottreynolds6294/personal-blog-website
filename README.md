My Personal Blog
This is a personal blog website. The website consits of a landing page, prompting the user to add blogs and the second page displays a list of all previus blogs.
The landing page consits of a form which includes input fields for username, title and content of the blog.
If one of the fields is left imcomplete a message prompts the user to complete all inputs.
When the submit button at the bottom of the form is clicked, the blog post is saved to localStorage and the user is redirected to the blog page.
The blog posts are rendered onto to the blog page from localStorage.
If localStorage is opened in the console, a JSON array is returned and the username, title and content of the blog can be viewed.
The blog page also contains a back button. When pressed the user is returned to the landing page where the user can add another blog.
The landing page and blog page also feature a light and dark mode toggle. When the toggle is switched to light, the "light mode" is visible and when the toggle is switched to dark, the "dark mode" is visible.
A footer is present on the blog page that will redirect the user to My Portfolio.
All code was completed by Scott Reynolds.
